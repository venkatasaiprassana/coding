         She’s got her father’s eyes

         Her father’s eyes

       Eyes that find the good in things

       When good is not around”

    <p id="par">My father is my hero and guide in my life. He is the one I look upon whenever I find myself in trouble. <br>
        My father has been my guiding force for all my major decisions in life. <br> In fact, I have never regretted adhering to his advice as it has always worked for me. 
        <br>He is a hardworking and passionate person. My father has a love for movies. <br>
        Whenever he gets time, he just loves to watch an old movie <br>In fact, at times we just fight as to who gets control of the television.
         <br> But at heart, we love to tease each other and play as well. </p>

    A role model is a person who I look up to and have greatly influenced in my life <br> and that special person is my father. <br> He possesses certain qualities of a good role model that set examples of being comical, supportive,<br> and shows great strengths of a hard worker. <br>

Being comical through hardships is one of a kind trait that my father holds.  <br>He is just full of joy and happiness that nothing stops him for being too gay. <br>Seeing him every day and night happily makes my teeth crackles smiling. <br> He'll have his struggles, his complications, his hardships, but he fights with a positive and comical attitude. <br> In example, he was terminated from his job for attending a court session and he was glad that they let him go. <br> Most people mourned for their jobs, but my father was happy. I gave him a glare look and said, "Okay." <br>
"I find it eccentric, but he is my father and who am I to judge him?"
